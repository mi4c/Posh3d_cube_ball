# Posh3d_cube_ball
This script is only tested psversion 5.1
My Background, i'm not a coder or advanced powershell scripter, just some n00b scripter. If I would be a coder I would have done this all with some other language. Or I would have used Unity or Blender... I just want to do pure powershell... Some cases there is no other way than inject c-sharp code.
I have some basic skills to do some powershell scripting and I do understand little c-sharp to be able to translate it to powershell code.
Many examples rely on injecting c-sharp code into powershell code, I try to avoid that and stay with the pure powershell syntax.
I really don't think I'm an advanced powershell scripter even I do share this "for fun" created script, that I do develop continuously. - I have to remember edit this sentence when I stop developing it. :D

This is just my test how to do some 3D graphics with powershell...
And to get more familiar with powershell classes. Currently I need to deep dive and try to understand more about quaternion, that I get my cam3 mouse look working better.

Issue: Ball movement is now currently broken, I fixed issue with camera 2 that script doesn't crash when moving camera. Now I need to figure out how to do that with the ball also.

Move ball with keys up,down,left,right

Look ball up and down with keys t,g in camera3

This is now currently also broken: Move skycam with keys w,s,a,d

zoomin/out skycam keys r,f

Change camera view num keys 1,2,3

Cam1 skycam
- maybe i'll try to transfer this camera under mouse control and change ball movent keys to wsad keys.

cam2 ball movement cam
- Doesn't anymore break the code

cam3 is about to be discarded later... Currently no value.
