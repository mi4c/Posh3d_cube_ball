# Posh3d_cube_ball
This is just my test how to do some 3D graphics with powershell...
And to get more familiar with powershell classes.
Powershell close it self as a built in safety reason, when multiple commands try to control the script.
Currently issue is that I try to give user too much control with timer ticks that are too fast and that triggers the powershell safety process.
Powershell idea better not to give a script ability to do it's own than give something that is not anymore accurate...

Move ball with keys up,down,left,right

Look ball up and down with keys t,g in camera3

Move skycam with keys w,s,a,d

zoomin/out skycam keys r,f

Change camera view num keys 1,2,3

Cam1 skycam
- maybe i'll try to transfer this camera under mouse control and change ball movent keys to wsad keys.

cam2 ball movement cam

cam3 ball lookcam, so you can look also up without messing the moving algorithm.
- i'm trying to transfer this camera free look into the mouse control
