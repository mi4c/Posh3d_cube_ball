# Posh3d_cube_ball
This was just my test how to do some 3D graphics with powershell...
And to get more familiar with powershell classes.

Move ball with keys up,down,left,right

Look ball up and down with keys t,g in camera3

Move skycam with keys w,s,a,d

zoomin/out skycam keys r,f

Change camera view num keys 1,2,3

Cam1 skycam

cam2 ball movement cam

cam3 ball lookcam, so you can look also up without messing the moving algorithm.
